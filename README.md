### Additional Substitution Layer for Encryption
The basic idea for this project is to add an a substitution layer after some form of block cipher encryption has been performed such as AES (hence the name). This will not just be any substitution layer, but a pirate substitution layer to abstract it more (and because its funny). This layer will be based upon a hashed version of the key used to encrypt so that way key length of the algorithm used does not matter.
